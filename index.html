      <h2>JavaScript</h2>

      <ul>

        <li><b>var</b> is a keyword used to declare a variable;</li>
        <li>the name of the variable (or container) = (which is the operator to assign specific data needed to be stored in the variable) the data it stores such as: <b>var shape = "circle";</b></li>
        <li><b>topics</b> is a variable that contains a <b>string</b> that includes the topics studied; the strings are surrounded by "quotation marks";</li>
        <li>to access the string, just refer back to the variable's name;</li>
        <li><b>console.log method</b> is used to output a message to the web console by adding an <b>argument</b>;</li>
        <li>in order to see the <b>console.log</b> in action, <b>Chrome DevTools</b> needs to be used (by pressing the right click, going to inspect, the pressing the console tab);</li>
        <li>the <b>topics</b> need to be defined AFTER using <b>console.log(topics);</b> to log it in the console - otherwise it would read <b>undefined</b> in the console;</li>
        <li><b>conditional statements</b> and <b>loops</b> can be used to control the order in which (or if) the code is executed;</li>
        <li><b>if</b> statements are used to introduce decision-making into the code; the computer will check if it is <b>truthy</b> - if it is <b>trule</b> or <b>truthy</b> then it will do whatever action between the {curly brackets} - if it is <b>null</b>/<b>0</b> or <b>falsy</b> then it will ignore it and move on;</li>
        <li>an <b>array</b> is a single cariable that is used to hold a group of (usually related) data; <b>var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</b></li>
        <li>a <b>for</b> loop contains 3 parts: the first statement (the starting point) - <b>var x = 0;</b>, the second statement (condition) - <b>x < shapes.length;</b>, and the final statment (allows the array to iterate over each item) <b>x++</b> -- so now the loop looks like: <b>for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) { // code block }</b></li>
        <li><b>Commenting out code</b> makes it inactive without deleting it: put /* before and */ after the block of code;</li>
        <li>a <b>function</b> is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task;</li>
        <li>Use the <b>function</b> keyword then add the name of the function followed by parenthesis such as: <b>function helloWorld()</b>;</li>
        <li><b>Control flow</b> is athe order in which a computer executes code in a script;</li>
        <li>each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon;</li>
