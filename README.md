# prework-study-guide

## Description

My motivation to build this project is closely related to why it was created. Retaining information in a short period of time is somewhat of a struggle for me. In order to learn I have to watch, read, and practice all while having help. During the prework I struggled with taking notes and remembering how to apply that information, but by creating the Prework Study Guide Application I was able to take notes while repetitively applying what I was learning. It easily solved that problem for me. I learned how to write important information down that I needed for later, structure the page to fit my needs, design it to be easily read, and how to make the entire page functional as a study guide. I also learned how to complete the Git Workflow in order to stay organized and track what I did.
